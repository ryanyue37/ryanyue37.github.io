* Lab 4

Lab 4 part 1 was one of my favorite labs because it talks about converting milliters to cups. I had to use multiple equations in order to get it converted to cups. Int and double had a huge help in figuring out how to do the equation.

* Lab 7

Lab 7 part 1 was another one of my favorite lab because we get to make a easy game. The name of the game is called high or low. The game is where one person types a "secret" number and the other person guesses what the number is. They only get 3 tries and after the third try, the game, it says "game over"

* Lab 3

Lab 3 part 1 is my last favorite lab because it was finding out the pizza price based on area and price. I learned a lot with setting up a system that would figure out the unit without having to do the math myself. This lab was also the beginning of std::cin and std::cout which helped with the later labs.
